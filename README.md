### Description

hi, I was working on a small project, were I needed to add properties to an control. so I decided to make this little quick code, does not use the DataGrid, as I did not want to use, over loaded controls, all this uses is TextBox and a ComboBox array. anyway code is faily simple, and it sort of does the job for small things, anyway hope you find it usfull.
